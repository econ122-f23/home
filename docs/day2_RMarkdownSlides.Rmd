## Quick Comment: Cloning the home page and compiling slides

- The recommended way to update course content is by cloning the home repository and pulling all the updates each week

- While click-through slides are useful for presentations, they may not be the best for review
- You can `Knit` the `.Rmd` file for the slides into a more conveient format
    - You can turn `incremental` off
    - You can output it to an `md` file
    - You can output it as `beamer_presentation`
    

## Replicability vs. Reproducibility

- Scientific findings should be **replicable**
    + Ann repeats Bob's lab experiment and gets different data but makes the same conclusions as Bob
- Statistical findings should be **reproducible**
    + Ann takes Bob's data and gets the exact same statistical results as Bob
- Statistical findings should be *easily* **reproducible**
    + Ann only needs to hit one button to reproduce Bob's results.
    + Ann only needs to hit one button to reproduce Bob's analysis on a *new data set*


## Email from your boss: {.build} 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
cat("Hi [Insert your name]
Your report was very interesting, but you used an old version of the data.  
Our newest loan data has 1000 loan cases, not 700 like you used.  

I'm really sorry you did all that work on the wrong dataset, but I expect you will 
easily be able to rerun your analysis on the newest data and get me a new report shortly. 

LOL, 
Barb")
```

## Open up Rstudio {.build}

- Open your `test-assignment` Rstudio Project
    - Click on the `Files` tab (lower right window)
    - Check the box by `test-assignment.Rmd`
    - Select menu **More > Copy** and rename it `Barb.Rmd`
- Make  this change to your first R chunk then knit your .Rmd:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
loans <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mgelman/data/master/CreditData.csv")
```
- This loads the correct (1000 case) data set
- Do your written answers match the R results?!


## Making your work reproducible

- You need a scriptable program (e.g. R, Python)
    + forces you to record the linear sequence of events in an analysis
    + should be able to retrace your steps
    + avoid point-n-click!
    + avoid any "by hand" actions (e.g. data cleaning in Excel)

## But scriptable doesn't always mean reproducible

- You should make your workflow ("soup to nuts") transparent and easily followed
    + meaningful file and variable names
    + don't overly complicate code, use packages when only when needed (the fewer dependencies the better)
    + only relevant code included
    + **written description of your analysis process and results alongside your code**


## Why should we strive for reproducibility?

- **Your closest collaborator is you six months ago, but you donâ€™t reply to emails.**
    + You need to document your workflow for both yourself and current/future collaborators
- Can you open one of your old code and understand 
    + the data used?
    + the questions you were trying to answer?
    + what your results mean?
- Statistical Consulting
    + from term to term we can continue, repeat or redo projects!
- R Markdown is a literate programming language that integrates R code, results and write-up.
    + literate = it is readable and easy to learn
    

## R Markdown: how it works | <img src="http://r4ds.had.co.nz/images/RMarkdownFlow.png" width=600>


1. You create a .Rmd file
2. You click the `knit` button in Rstudio (or run the `rmarkdown` package command `render("my.Rmd")`).
3. A compiled html/pdf/word/... document magically appears
- Behind the scenes: 
    + `rmarkdown` uses `knitr` package to create a .md (Markdown) file
    + the document converter **pandoc** takes the .md file and creates a html/pdf/word... document!
    
## Writing a R Markdown document | 1. Formatting text

- References: [Hadley's page](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html), [Rstudio page](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html), [RStudio cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/rmarkdown-cheatsheet.pdf)
- Simple  rules for 
    + section headers (`#`,`##`,etc)
    + lists (need ~2 tabs to create sublists)
    + formatting (bold `**`, italics `*`)
    + tables
    + R syntax (use backward tick ` ` `)
    + web links `[linked text](url)`
    + latex math equations $\beta_1 + \beta_2$
    + in HTML docs, you can use HTML commands (in pdf, latex commands)
    
## Writing a R Markdown document | 2. R chunks

- Begin with ` ```{r}` and end with ` ``` `
- Can run code within chunk in the R console
    + as an entire chunk 
    + line by line

## Writing a R Markdown document | 2. R chunk options {.build}

- many options control the output produced/shown by a chunk 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
cat("```{r, options}
code stuff
```")
```
- `echo=FALSE` omits R code but not results
- `include=FALSE` omits R code and results
- `eval=FALSE` code chunk is not run, but code displayed
- `results='hide'` or `fig.show='hide'` runs code but suppresses output 
- `message=FALSE` or `warning=FALSE` suppresses messages/warnings in output
- `error=TRUE` knits doc even with a code error

## Writing a R Markdown document | 2. R chunk global options {.build}

- Set global document chunk options at the start of your file:
```{r, echo=FALSE}
cat("```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse=TRUE, prompt=TRUE, comment=NULL, 
eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, include=TRUE)
```")
```
- evaluate R chunks and include results, suppress (package) messages
- `prompt=TRUE` shows `>` prompt in front of commands
- `comment=NULL` no comment `##` in front of output 
- `collapse=TRUE` compresses code/results in the chunk output


## Writing a R Markdown document | 2. R chunk names {.build}

- Name your code chunks: 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
cat("```{r ChunkName1} 
my fancy code chunk
```")
```
- can see in drop-down menu (lower left)
- can reuse named chunks by just referencing chunk name
```{r, echo=FALSE}
cat("```{r ChunkName1} 
```")
```

## Writing a R Markdown document | 2. Inline code {.build}

- You can embed one R code command in your text by wrapping it in ```r`` followed by \` 

    + .Rmd file: The square root of 77 is ``r` sqrt(77)`
    + .md file:  The square root of 77 is `r sqrt(77)`
- Steps towards reproducibility
    + Use inline commands when reporting results/stats in case your data changes...

## Writing a R Markdown document | 3. Header

- The YAML header is always positioned at the top of a .Rmd, surrounded by   `---`
- Basic elements are `title`, `author` and `date`.

## Writing a R Markdown document | 3. Header

- `output` tells pandoc what form the final document should take
    + html_document (can't view in GitHub)
    + pdf_document (need MikTex or MacTex installed)
    + github_document (creates a .md Markdown doc)
    + ioslides_presentation, beamer_presentation
- each output type can be further refined with formatting options
    + e.g. for these slides I specify `widescreen=true`, `incremental=true`, and `keep_md=false`
    + for documents, you might use `fig.caption=true`
- for help: in Rstudio select `Help > Cheatsheets > R Markdown Reference Guide`

## Final comments

- Start working towards writing reproducible analysis
    + doesn't happen overnight
    + using R Markdown is a good start!
    + I don't expect you to use inline code for all your assignments

- For the rest of today
    + finish up software setup
    + work on test assignment
    + work on class activity
